Hi, I'm David Supple, and I really enjoy leveraging data to find solutions and create corresponding results via presentations and reports to tell a compelling story.  

My strengths include:
  - Analytical problem solving abilities
  - Ability to think logically about the behavior of numbers and make inferences
  - Able to see the big picture, make thoughtful tradeoffs and focus on what matters
  - Collaborating with others
